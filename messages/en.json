      "title": "What are Dental Implants?",
      "point1": "Dental implants are a procedure to replace missing tooth roots with titanium posts that provide a strong foundation for permanent artificial teeth. They are considered the optimal solution for replacing missing teeth as they mimic natural teeth in both appearance and function.",
      "point2": "Dental implants use materials that are biologically compatible with the human body such as titanium, ensuring the body doesn't reject the implant. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and takes 30 to 90 minutes depending on the number of implants required.",
      "point3": "Dental implants differ from traditional prosthetics in that they preserve jaw bones from deterioration and don't require grinding adjacent teeth as with traditional bridges. This makes them the healthiest and longest-lasting solution for replacing missing teeth.",
      "point4": "The success rate of dental implants reaches 98% in the lower jaw and 95% in the upper jaw, lasting a lifetime with proper care. The implant consists of three parts: the fixture that fixes into the bone, the abutment, and the ceramic crown."

      "point1": "Improved appearance and self-confidence: Dental implants look and feel exactly like natural teeth, restoring your beautiful smile and confidence while speaking and laughing.",
      "point2": "Improved speech and chewing: Unlike removable dentures, dental implants allow you to chew effectively and speak clearly without worrying about teeth moving or falling out.",
      "point3": "Comfort and durability: Dental implants are fixed and comfortable, no need for daily removal or adhesive materials. With proper care, they can last a lifetime.",
      "point4": "Preserving jaw and bone health: Dental implants prevent jaw bone deterioration that occurs after tooth loss, maintain natural facial features, and prevent premature aging appearance."

      "step1": "Diagnosis and planning: We perform comprehensive dental examination and 3D imaging to assess jaw bone condition and determine appropriate implant locations using the latest diagnostic equipment.",
      "step2": "Surgical implantation: Under local anesthesia, titanium implants are inserted into the jaw bone at pre-determined locations. This step typically takes 30 to 60 minutes per implant.",
      "step3": "Healing period: The recovery period ranges from 3 to 6 months for the lower jaw, and 4 to 8 months for the upper jaw. During this period, the implant integrates with the jaw bone in a process called osseointegration.",
      "step4": "Final crown placement: After complete healing, the abutment and ceramic crown are installed, custom-designed to match the color and shape of your natural teeth, giving you a natural and harmonious smile."

But can general anesthesia be used for dental treatments? What cases require it? In fact, some dental procedures may require the use of general anesthesia, which are exceptional cases including: young children who cannot cooperate during treatment, people with special needs, and major surgical procedures such as dental implants or jaw surgery. In this article, we will learn about the cases that require full anesthesia in dental surgery, and how these operations are performed safely and efficiently at ToothMate Dental Clinic in Maadi to provide exceptional dental care with the highest degrees of comfort for our patients.",

          "During the procedure, all vital functions are carefully monitored, including: blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and blood oxygen levels.",

          "q": "What is the appropriate age for braces?",

          "a": "Some patients don't need braces installation for both jaws together, but only upper jaw braces are sufficient if the problem is limited to it, such as having simple gaps or protrusion in front teeth. Usually, the price for upper jaw braces only is lower than the full braces price, because the number of visits and follow-up is relatively less."
        },
        {
          "q": "What is the price for lower jaw braces only?",
          "a": "Similarly, some patients may suffer from teeth crowding in the lower jaw only or teeth tilting inward. In these cases, the treatment plan is simpler and faster compared to full braces, and it depends on the jaw's response speed and teeth deviation degree. Generally, the price for lower jaw braces only is much lower than the cost of both jaws together, due to fewer visits and easier tooth movement."

      "point1": "Root canal treatment is a therapeutic procedure aimed at saving damaged or infected teeth instead of extracting them. During this procedure, the inflamed or dead nerve is removed from inside the tooth, then the root canals are cleaned, sterilized and filled with a special material to prevent reinfection.",
      "point2": "Root canal is performed when decay reaches the tooth nerve or when there is inflammation or infection in the tooth pulp. This treatment is necessary when you feel severe tooth pain, sensitivity to cold or hot, gum swelling, or tooth discoloration.",
      "point3": "Root canal is performed under local anesthesia making it a painless procedure. The doctor uses special precision instruments to carefully clean the root canals, then fills them with a medical rubber material called 'gutta percha' to ensure complete canal sealing.",
      "point4": "After successful root canal treatment, the tooth usually needs a crown or restoration to protect it from fracture and restore its shape and natural function. This way, the tooth can continue to perform its function for many years, often for a lifetime."

    "intro": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dental caries affects about 2.5 billion people worldwide. Therefore, dental fillings, whether cosmetic or traditional, are an inevitable solution to eliminate this decay and prevent its spread to other teeth. After removing the infected part of the tooth, it is replaced with a restorative material that prevents bacteria from returning and preserves the tooth's structure and function, stopping the progression of decay and preventing more serious complications such as nerve inflammation or complete tooth loss. In the following lines, we will explain many details about the types of cosmetic fillings, the difference between cosmetic and traditional fillings, and the prices of cosmetic fillings.",

    "intro": "Root canal treatment is one of the most important therapeutic procedures in dentistry, representing a radical step to save teeth from extraction, restore their natural function in chewing and speaking, while maintaining their aesthetic appearance. However, the price of root canal treatment in Egypt varies between clinics and medical centers, as well as from one patient to another, according to several factors including: degree of inflammation, number of tooth roots, type of tools used, and doctor's experience. During an analytical study that included 74 researches worldwide, it was found that about 8.2% of teeth underwent root canal treatment globally, meaning that out of every 100 teeth, approximately 8 to 9 teeth received root canal treatment, thus such statistics show the prevalence of root canal procedure. In this article, we will review in detail everything related to the cost of root canal treatment at ToothMate clinics and the factors affecting it, so you can understand prices clearly and make the optimal decision to maintain your dental health.",
